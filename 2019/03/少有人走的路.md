## <a id="1.1">前言</a>

心智成熟的旅程不但是一项复杂又艰巨的任务, 而且是毕生的任务.

Achieving spiritual growth is a complex, arduous and lifelong task.



## <a id="1.2">自律</a>

自律是解决人生问题最主要的工具, 也是消除人生痛苦的最主要的方法.



人生苦难重重. 

这是个伟大的真理, 是世界上最伟大的真理之一. 它的伟大之处就在于, 一旦我们领悟了这句话的真谛, 就能从苦难中解脱出来, 实现人生的超越. 只要我们真正理解并接受了人生苦难重重的事实, 那么我们就会释然, 再也不会对人生的苦难耿耿于怀了.

遗憾的是, 大多数人却不愿意正视人生的苦难. 他们一遇到问题和痛苦, 不是怨天尤人, 就是抱怨自己命苦, 仿佛人生本来就应该既舒适又顺利似的. 

Life is difficult. 

This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult-once we truly understand and accept it-then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters.

Most do not fully see this truth that life is difficult. Instead they moan more or less incessantly, noisily or subtly about the enormity of their problems, their burdens, and their difficulties as if life were generally easy, as if life should be easy.



解决人生问题的关键在于自律. 人若缺少自律, 就不可能解决任何麻烦和问题. 在某些方面自律, 只能解决某些问题, 全面的自律才能解决人生所有的问题.

人生是一个不断面对问题, 并解决问题的过程. 

问题是我们成功与失败的分水岭. 承受面对问题和解决问题的痛苦, 我们就能从痛苦中学到很多东西. 美国开国先哲本杰明富兰克林说过: "唯有痛苦才能给人带来教益." 面对问题, 智慧的人不会因为害怕痛苦而选择逃避, 他们会迎上前去, 坦然承受问题带给自己的痛苦, 直至把问题彻底解决.

Discipline is the basic set of tools we require to solve life's problems. Without discipline we can solve nothing. With only some discipline we can solve only some problems. With total discipline we can solve all problems.

It is in this whole process of meeting and solving problems that life has its meaning.

Problems are the cutting edge that distinguishes between success and failure. It is through the pain of confronting and resolving problems that we learn. As Benjamin Franklin said, "Those things that hurt, instruct." It if for this reason that wise people learn not to dread but actually to welcome problems the pain of problems.



回避问题和逃避痛苦的倾向, 是人类心理疾病的根源. 

正确的做法是我们要让自己, 也要让我们的孩子认识到, 人生的问题和痛苦具有非凡的价值. 用于承担责任, 敢于面对困难, 才能够使心灵变得健康.

自律是解决人生问题最主要的工具, 也是消除人生痛苦最重要的方法. 自律有四个原则: 推迟满足感, 承担责任, 忠于事实, 保持平衡.

This tendency to avoid problems and the emotional suffering inherent in them is the primary basis of all human mental illness.

Therefore let us inculcate in ourselves and in our children the means of achieving mental and spiritual health. By this I mean let us teach ourselves and our children the necessity for suffering and the value thereof, the need to face problems directly and to experience the pain involved. 

What are these tools, these techniques of suffering, these means of experiencing the pain of problems constructively that I call discipline? There are four: delaying of gratification, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth, and balancing.



#### 推迟满足感 delaying gratification

推迟满足感, 就是不贪图暂时的安逸, 先苦后甜, 重新设置人生快乐与痛苦的次序: 首先, 面对问题并感受痛苦; 然后, 解决问题并享受更大的快乐. 

Delaying gratification is a process of scheduling the pain and pleasure of life in such a way as to enhance the pleasure by meeting and experiencing the pain first and getting it over with. It is the only decent way to live.
